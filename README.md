A detailed and complete documentation of the code and the whole project may follow at a later date.

The folder "lambda_function_1" and "lambda_function_2" feature all of the code used in the two lambda functions, that are started by different triggers on AWS.
Under the folder "sql_databases" you can find the SQL-statements for creating the tables.
The folder "microcontroller" contains the code and folders that have to be flashed on the microcontroller using Micropython.
